This project addresses the following components, which together define the scope and evaluation criteria of the work:

1. Predictive Task Definition

Clearly define the predictive task under study.

Describe how model performance on this task is evaluated.

Identify relevant baseline models used for comparison.

Explain how the validity and reliability of the model’s predictions are assessed.

Ensure that the selected task and models align with course content. Models from outside the course may be explored, but models covered in the course must be implemented as baselines or comparison points.

2. Exploratory Analysis, Data Collection, and Preprocessing

Context: Describe the dataset, including its source, purpose, and data collection process.

Discussion: Explain how the data was cleaned, processed, and prepared for modeling (or describe any preprocessing already performed).

Code & Analysis: Support findings with exploratory analysis such as tables, visualizations, and summary statistics.

3. Modeling Approach

Context: Formulate the problem as a machine learning task, specifying inputs, outputs, and optimization objectives.

Discussion: Compare different modeling approaches, highlighting trade-offs such as model complexity, efficiency, and implementation challenges.

Code Walkthrough: Explain the model architecture, design decisions, and key implementation details.

4. Evaluation

Context: Define the evaluation strategy and justify the choice of performance metrics.

Discussion: Describe baseline methods and demonstrate how the proposed model improves upon them.

Code & Results: Detail the evaluation pipeline and present results using tables, plots, and statistical summaries.

5. Related Work

Discuss how this dataset, or similar datasets, have been used in prior research.

Summarize how previous work has approached the same or closely related predictive tasks.
